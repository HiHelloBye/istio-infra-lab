# istio-infra-lab
This repository is a hands-on lab for exploring the Istio service mesh in Kubernetes-based cloud-native environments, documenting research-driven experiments and best practices from my recent professional experience. It focuses on optimizing traffic management, enhancing observability, and strengthening security-curated for graduate school applications.


## Overview
This portfolio consolidates my recent applied experience with Istio, including ConfigMap and Secret centralization, VirtualService configuration, and practical labs focused on traffic management, observability, and security. It highlights my technical expertise and directly aligns with my graduate research interests in optimizing distributed network systems.


## Practical Context
This lab is informed by my backend development experience, where I worked on:
- Centralizing ConfigMap/Secret management in an OCP environment
- Applying Istio for internal traffic routing and service control
- Integrating ArgoCD with Jenkins for CI/CD pipeline


### Tech Stack
- **Service Mesh** : Istio (VirtualService, Gateway, DestinationRule)
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, Secret)
- **Observability**: Kiali
- **GitOps**: ArgoCD
