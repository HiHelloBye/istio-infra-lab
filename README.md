# istio-infra-lab
Hands-on lab for exploring Istio service mesh in Kubernetes-based cloud-native environments. This repository documents research-driven experiments and practices to optimize traffic management, enhance observability, and strengthen security features of Istio, based on my recent work experience and created for graduate school applications.

## Overview


## Practical Context
This lab is informed by my backend development experience, where I worked on:
- Centralizing ConfigMap/Secret management in an OCP environment
- Applying Istio for internal traffic routing and service control
- Integrating ArgoCD with Jenkins for CI/CD pipeline


### Tech Stack
- **Service Mesh** : Istio (VirtualService, Gateway, DestinationRule)
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, Secret)
- **Observability**: Kiali
- **GitOps**: ArgoCD
